  <p>
  Hello {{mentorFirst}},
  <br />
  <br />
  Thank you so much again {{mentorFirst}}, for volunteering! You have successfully accepted your mentorship for {{studentName}}. Please contact {{parentEmail}} as soon as possible (if you have not already done so)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Remember to cc the parent email on every email you send, as explained in the mentor guidelines. We recommend that you start with a 30 minute session to introduce yourselves and decide how the mentorship will proceed, including:
  <ul>
    <li>The studentâ€™s academic support/needs</li>
    <li>The structure of the sessions</li>
    <li>Practice problems</li>
    <li>Teaching content</li>
    <li>Explaining specific subjects</li>
    <li>Set times and dates that are convenient for both you and the student
        Frequency of the sessions</li>
  </ul>
  <br /><br />
  Moving forward, if you have any questions, please email covedmentors@gmail.com. If you have not already done so, feel free to join our slack community. Thank you again, and we are excited to hear about how the mentorship goes!
